# Past

06.2018 - Start of this project, getting used to Unity and Visual Studio/Resharper

08.2018 - Pathfinding, Products and production inside of factories

09.2018 - First iteration of cities, own blender models, city placement, vehicle transport logic

10.2018 - Factory productivity based on location factors (biomes), Main Menu

11.2018 - Moved the project to this repository, fix problems

12.2018 - Break due to university

03.2019 - Updated Ui Design, added proper curve animations for vehicles

# Future Plans

## Terrain Generation
- Water & Deep Water zones
- Water animation

## Transport System
- Visuals: Loaded products visible
- More vehicles: planes, trains, ships
- Storage buildings

## Traffic System
- Stopping on intersections
- Slow down behind slower vehicles

## Progression System
- Unlock new buildings and vehicles
- Bigger supply chains require better vehicles

## Performance
- Pathsfinding process moved from vehicles to buildings -> Easier update of the current situation
- Multithreading for vehicle movement and loading logic -> Find a workaround for multithreading in Unity
